#The asnwers in this file is meant to be written when I just received the legacy code, so before any edits or updates made by me. 

(a) The game is a multiple choice command lin game where the user has to guess the capital of the state/country correctly given 1 correct choice and 3 random choices. The player can earn points by answering questions correctly, and receive my grade based on my score at the end of the game. 

(b) As a User, I can answer a question correctly, so that I earn points toward my total score. 
As a User, I can select a game mode, so that I can be tested on the capitals of either the state or the country. 
As a User, I can earn points toward my total score, so that I can get the corresponding letter grade. 

(c) The software does indded run, and each game mode works correctly. There are four game modes with two that deal with US state capitals and two that deal with world capitals. 

(d) As a User, I want to be able to test myself with a mixture of US state capitals and world capitals, so that I can test all of my knowledge at once.
As a User, I want to be able to pick how many questions I answer, so that I set how long the game will be.
As a User, I want to know my grade more specifically, so that I can know my precise grade. 

(e) The current README.md provides the basic information to understand the concept of the game. Additional informations that I will add are the instruction of how to run the game, a higher level decription of the program works with any additoinal features into the game, a description of the various files/directories, and a project history. 

(f) The build.xml file can be cleaned up as Github can replace the publish and downlaod targets, but the run target does not run the game. The compile target seems self-explantory, but it could use a brief description. The jar target can also use a brief description.  

(g) The current issues are very starightforward, and most of the issues can be solved quickly and efficiently. The hardest issue to tackle would be creating a GUI for the game. I believe that there are enough issues to earn 1000 points when the additional features are included. 
500 points mark: issues #15, #14, #13, #11, #9 (200 + 50 + 150 + 50 + 50) 
1000 points mark: issues above & #4, #6, #8, #10 (500 + 100 + 200 + 100 + 100) 
+125 extra credit points: issues #16 (200 points, but can only get 125) 

(h) The only additional issue that I added is that there are text files that are stored in two directory, and only I need one copy of those text files in one directory.

(i) The code is relatively simple to read and understand since the code is all contained within one class. In the beginning of the Game.java file, all the accessors and mutators are clearly named and simple. The arraylists read in from the *.txt files to create the Arraylists that the class uses to compare and randomly generate capitals and states/countries. Probably the most important methods are the generate4(Country)Capitals. Most of the methods deal with printing out information or reading in a prompt from the user, but the generate4Capital methods are instrumental in getting both the answer and choices for the player to the prompting methods.

(j) There are JUnit tests that only test few methods used in the program. Hence, I plan to expand the test coverage, so the JUnit tests will cover every method used in the game.
