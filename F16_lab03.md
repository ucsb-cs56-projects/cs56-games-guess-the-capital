a) Game where you name capitals of countries and states.

b) As a student I can play this game to learn capitals of US states and the world.
   I can choose to answer 10 or 50 questions. I also have the option of playing just with the capitals of US states,
   just with countries' capitals or both together.
c) The software runs and lets you play the game through terminal. It lets you choose which set of capitals to play with 
    as mentioned above. It also allows you to replay the game and gives you a grade at the end of each session.
d) As a student I would like to add more options for the number of questions. I would also like an option to play the game
    just with user input to type the full answer out. Another option would to have a mode that makes you guess the state or
    country based on the capital.
e) One addition I would make would be to add screenshots of gameplay to give a new player a better idea of what the game
  looks like when it runs. I would also add the previous user stories directly to the README.md.
f) Targets that need descriptions include the javadoc and jar files
g) Yes there are enough issues to earn 1000 points and the issues are clear in terms of what the expectations are.
h) The game could be made as a web app
